# RealEstatePricePredictor
Project Overview This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate predictions of property values based on features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. This model can assist in data-driven decision-making for investors, buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals. Problem Statement Real estate pricing is influenced by numerous factors, and manually evaluating properties can be both time-consuming and inaccurate. This project aims to create a data-driven model capable of predicting property prices, reducing human bias and improving accuracy. By leveraging historical property data, the model will provide insights into market trends and expected price fluctuations. Key Features Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured proper formatting of the dataset for modeling. Feature Engineering: Created and transformed features to better represent underlying trends in property data. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted visualizations and statistical analyses to understand relationships between features. Modeling: Implemented various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost to predict real estate prices. Evaluation: Compared model performance using key metrics such as RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R² Score, and MAE (Mean Absolute Error). Deployment: An example of model deployment is included to demonstrate how predictions can be served in a real-world application. Workflow Data Collection: A dataset of real estate transactions with features like property size, location, number of rooms, and price. Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values, outliers, and normalizing features. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualized data distribution, correlations, and relationships between features. Feature Engineering: Added new features like price per square foot, created dummy variables for categorical data, and more. Model Building: Built multiple models and fine-tuned them using hyperparameter optimization. Model Evaluation: Compared models based on error metrics and selected the best-performing one. Prediction: Generated predictions for property prices on new, unseen data. Tools & Technologies Used Programming Language: Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, XGBoost Version Control: Git & GitHub Model Deployment: Flask (Optional) Data Sources: Publicly available real estate datasets Results Best Model: [Name of the best-performing model, e.g., XGBoost] Performance Metrics: RMSE: [value] MAE: [value] R² Score: [value] Future Improvements Incorporating external economic data for improved price prediction accuracy. Deployment of the model as a web application using Flask or FastAPI. Implementation of real-time data updates to keep the model predictions current with market trends.
