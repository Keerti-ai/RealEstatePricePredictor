# RealEstatePricePredictor
Project Overview: This project focuses on predicting real estate prices using various machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide accurate predictions of property values based on features such as location, square footage, number of bedrooms, and other relevant factors. This model can assist in data-driven decision-making for investors, buyers, sellers, and real estate professionals.
Problem Statement: Real estate pricing is influenced by numerous factors, and manually evaluating properties can be both time-consuming and inaccurate. This project aims to create a data-driven model capable of predicting property prices, reducing human bias and improving accuracy. By leveraging historical property data, the model will provide insights into market trends and expected price fluctuations.
Key Features:
Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and ensured proper formatting of the dataset for modeling. 
Feature Engineering: Created and transformed features to better represent underlying trends in property data. 
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted visualizations and statistical analyses to understand relationships between features.
Modeling: Implemented various machine learning models such as Linear Regression, Decision Trees and Lasso Regression to predict real estate prices.
Prediction: Generated predictions for property prices on new, unseen data. Tools & Technologies Used Programming Language: Python Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
